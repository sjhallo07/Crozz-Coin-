# Network-specific builds:
# The Sui dependency below uses 'framework/testnet' revision.
# For TESTNET deployment: Use as-is and run `sui move build`
# For MAINNET deployment: Change 'framework/testnet' to 'framework/mainnet'
#   Then run `sui move build` and `sui client publish --gas-budget <BUDGET>`
#
# Alternative: Use the Sui CLI's --default-move-flavor flag:
#   sui move build --default-move-flavor mainnet
